# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 1. Problem Definition
**Goal:** Predict which customers are likely to churn next month and identify the strongest churn drivers to enable actionable retention strategies.

**Context:** Customer churn is a critical metric for telecom and SaaS companies. Retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones. This project leverages machine learning to identify at-risk customers and understand the factors driving their decisions.

## 2. Project Summary
This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn. It includes:
- **Data Ingestion:** Synthetic generation of a Telco Churn dataset (mimicking the Kaggle standard).
- **EDA:** Comprehensive analysis of distributions, missing values, and class imbalance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of tenure buckets, interaction features, and usage metrics.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of Logistic Regression (baseline) and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation using ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrices.
- **Interpretability:** Analysis of feature importance and SHAP values to explain model decisions.
- **Dashboarding:** A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for business stakeholders.

## 3. Implementation Steps
The project is structured as follows:

### A. Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Generate the dataset:
   ```bash
   python generate_data.py
   ```

### B. Analysis Pipeline
Run the main analysis script to perform EDA, training, and evaluation:
```bash
python churn_model.py
```
This script will:
- Load the data.
- Perform EDA and save plots (e.g., `churn_distribution.png`).
- Engineer features.
- Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- Evaluate models and save performance plots (`roc_curve.png`).
- Generate feature importance and SHAP summary plots (`feature_importance.png`, `shap_summary.png`).

### C. Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard to explore the data and model predictions:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## 4. Key Insights
- **Contract Type:** Customers with "Month-to-month" contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those with one or two-year contracts.
- **Tenure:** New customers (0-12 months) are at the highest risk of churning.
- **Charges:** Higher monthly charges and "Electronic check" payment methods are positively correlated with churn.
- **Fiber Optic:** Customers with Fiber Optic internet service show higher churn rates, potentially indicating service quality issues or competitive pricing pressure.

## 5. Final Outputs

### CV Line
> "Built a telecom churn prediction model using feature engineering and logistic regression; achieved ROC-AUC of ~0.82 and delivered segment-level insights enabling targeted retention strategies."

### Interview Pitch
> "I analyzed subscriber behavior, engineered tenure and usage-based features, and built a logistic regression churn model enhanced with SHAP interpretability. The analysis showed contract type and monthly charges as the strongest churn drivers. I also identified high-risk customer segments and produced insights for targeted retention campaigns."

## 6. Visualizations
The following visualizations are generated by the pipeline:
- **Churn Distribution:** Shows the class imbalance between churned and retained customers.
- **ROC Curve:** Compares the performance of Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlights the top factors contributing to churn (e.g., Contract, Tenure, InternetService).
- **SHAP Summary:** Provides a detailed view of how each feature impacts the model's prediction for individual customers.
